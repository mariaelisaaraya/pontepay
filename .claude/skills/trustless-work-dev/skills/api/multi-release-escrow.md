# Multi-Release Escrow

Multi-release escrows release funds incrementally as each milestone is completed and approved.

## When to Use

- Milestone-based payments
- Progressive payment structure
- Projects requiring partial payments
- Long-term projects with multiple deliverables

## API Headers

All endpoints require these headers:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `x-api-key` | `<your_api_key>` |

**Note:** Use `x-api-key` header (not `Authorization: Bearer`).

## Deploy Escrow

**Endpoint:** `POST /deployer/multi-release`

### Request Schema

```typescript
interface MultiReleaseContract {
  signer: string;                    // Entity that signs the transaction that deploys and initializes the escrow
  engagementId: string;              // Unique identifier for the escrow
  title: string;                     // Name of the escrow
  description: string;               // Text describing the function of the escrow
  roles: {
    approver: string;                // Address of the entity requiring the service
    serviceProvider: string;          // Address of the entity providing the service
    platformAddress: string;          // Address of the entity that owns the escrow
    releaseSigner: string;           // Address of the user in charge of releasing the escrow funds to the service provider
    disputeResolver: string;         // Address in charge of resolving disputes within the escrow
    // Note: No receiver in roles - each milestone has its own receiver
  };
  platformFee: number;              // Commission that the platform will receive when the escrow is completed
  milestones: {
    description: string;             // Text describing the function of the milestone
    amount: number;                   // Amount to be transferred upon completion of this milestone
    receiver: string;                 // Address where milestone proceeds will be sent to
    // Note: Do NOT include "approvedFlag" or "status" when deploying
  }[];
  trustline: {
    address: string;                 // Public address establishing permission to accept and use a specific token
    symbol: string;                   // Official abbreviation representing the token (e.g., "USDC", "EURC")
  };
}
```

- `description` (required)
- `roles` (required) - without receiver

}
```

## Query Escrow Status

```typescript
const response = await http.get(
  `/helper/get-escrow-by-contract-ids?contractIds=${contractId}&validateOnChain=true`,
  {
    headers: {
      "x-api-key": your_api_key,
    },
  }
);

const escrows = await response.data;
// Check escrow.milestones[] for individual milestone status
```

## Key Differences from Single-Release

- **Per-milestone amounts**: Each milestone has its own `amount` field
- **Per-milestone receivers**: Each milestone has its own `receiver` field
- **Incremental releases**: Funds released as each milestone is approved
- **No single amount field**: Total is sum of milestone amounts
- **milestoneIndex as string**: In approve/release endpoints
- **Withdraw remaining funds**: Available after completion
- **Progressive payments**: Service provider gets paid incrementally
- **Milestone-specific disputes**: Disputes are per-milestone, not entire escrow

## Common Patterns

### Using Axios

```typescript
import axios from "axios";

const http = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://api.trustlesswork.com",
  timeout: 10000,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": your_api_key,
  },
});
```

### Transaction Flow

```typescript
// 1. Call endpoint
const response = await http.post("/endpoint", payload);

// 2. Get unsigned transaction
const { unsignedTransaction } = response.data;

// 3. Sign transaction
const { signedTxXdr } = await signTransaction(unsignedTransaction, {
  address,
  networkPassphrase: WalletNetwork.TESTNET,
});

// 4. Send transaction
const tx = await http.post("/helper/send-transaction", {
  signedXdr: signedTxXdr,
});

// 5. Handle response
const { data } = tx;
```

### Calculate Total Funding Amount

```typescript
function calculateTotalFunding(milestones: Milestone[], platformFee: number): number {
  const milestoneTotal = milestones.reduce((sum, m) => sum + m.amount, 0);
  return milestoneTotal + platformFee;
}

// Example
const milestones = [
  { amount: 2000, description: "Milestone 1", receiver: "..." },
  { amount: 3000, description: "Milestone 2", receiver: "..." },
];
const platformFee = 200;
const totalFunding = calculateTotalFunding(milestones, platformFee); // 5200
```
