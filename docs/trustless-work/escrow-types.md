# Escrow Types

Trustless Work supports multiple escrow types, each tailored for different workflows. Whether you're building a marketplace, a grant platform, or a gig app, choosing the right escrow logic helps you balance simplicity, flexibility, and trust.

***

### Single-Release Escrow

A Single-Release Escrow holds funds until *all* milestones (verifiable checkpoints, like "design done" or "code deployed") are completed and approved. Only then is the *entire* amount released in one go. It’s built for projects where trust builds across multiple steps but payout happens once.

**Build it like this:**

1. **Deposit:** Funds are locked upfront by any party (e.g., a client) via a Stellar wallet.
2. **Milestone Completion:** The Service Provider (e.g., a freelancer) marks each milestone complete (e.g., "Logo delivered," "Site live").
3. **Approval & Release:** The Approver (e.g., the client) verifies *all* milestones. Once all are signed off, the Release Signer (e.g., the platform) releases the full amount to the Receiver, minus any Platform fee.

**Example:** A freelancer on a marketplace delivers a website (milestones: wireframe, design, launch). The buyer (Approver) confirms all are done, and the platform (Release Signer) releases the full payment.

***

### Multi-Release Escrow

A Multi-Release Escrow releases funds incrementally as each milestone is completed and approved. It’s designed for staged projects where trust and payments build step-by-step, reducing risk.

**Build it like this:**

1. **Deposit:** Funds are deposited upfront or in parts via Stellar wallets.
2. **Milestone Completion & Review:** The Service Provider (e.g., a DAO contributor) marks each milestone complete (e.g., "Prototype built"). The Approver (e.g., DAO voters) reviews each.
3. **Incremental Release:** For each approved milestone, the Release Signer (e.g., the platform) releases that milestone’s portion of funds to the Receiver. Dispute Resolvers handle conflicts, adjusting amounts or canceling if needed. (Note: Per-milestone payouts are coming, per doc.)

**Example:** A DAO funds a developer for a project (milestones: code v1, v2, v3). Each milestone’s approval releases a portion of stablecoins, with a Dispute Resolver stepping in if voters contest progress.

**Why use it?**

* ✅ Flexible: Pay per milestone, not all at once.

| Aspect     | Single-Release                            | Multi-Release          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Payouts    | All at once, post all milestones          | Per milestone          |
| Use Case   | Freelance with staged checks              | Grant disbursements    |
| Complexity | Medium (multiple milestones, one release) | High (staged releases) |

### Quick Tips:

* Use **Single-Release** to get started fast.
* Use **Multi-Release** when you need milestone-based control.
* All escrows are **non-custodial**, programmable, and stablecoin-native.

### JSON Examples

Here are two minimal JSON snippets that highlight the structural difference between **Single-Release** and **Multi-Release** escrows. These aren’t full schemas, just the essentials so a builder can “see it” at a glance.

***

### 📝 Example: Single-Release (with multiple milestones)

```json
{
  "contractId": "C...ESCROWADDRESS",
  "engagementId": "order-123",
  "title": "Website Development",
  "description": "Build and deliver a marketing website",
  "roles": {
    "approver": "G...CLIENT",
    "serviceProvider": "G...FREELANCER",
    "releaseSigner": "G...SIGNER",
    "platformAddress": "G...PLATFORM",
    "disputeResolver": "G...RESOLVER",
    "receiver": "G...FREELANCER"
  },
  "amount": 1000,
  "platformFee": 0.5,
  "milestones": [
    {
      "description": "Deliver homepage design",
      "status": "Approved",
      "approved": true
    },
    {
      "description": "Deploy full website",
      "status": "Pending",
      "approved": false
    }
  ],
  "flags": {
    "disputed": false,
    "released": false,
    "resolved": false
  },
  "trustline": {
    "address": "G...USDCISSUER",
  }
}
```

👉 Even with multiple milestones, **all must be approved** before the single payout of `1000` USDC is released.

### 📝 Example: Multi-Release

```json
{
  "contractId": "C...ESCROWADDRESS",
  "engagementId": "grant-456",
  "title": "Research Grant",
  "description": "Funding project in two phases",
  "roles": {
    "approver": "G...FUNDER",
    "serviceProvider": "G...RESEARCHER",
    "releaseSigner": "G...SIGNER",
    "platformAddress": "G...PLATFORM",
    "disputeResolver": "G...RESOLVER",
  },
  "platformFee": 0.5,
  "milestones": [
    {
      "description": "Submit interim report",
      "amount": 500,
      "status": "Approved",
      "flags": { "approved": true, "released": true, "disputed": false, "resolved": false },
      "receiver": "G...RESEARCHER"
    },
    {
      "description": "Publish final report",
      "amount": 500,
      "status": "Pending",
      "flags": { "approved": false, "released": false, "disputed": false, "resolved": false },
      "receiver": "G...RESEARCHER"
    }
  ],
  "trustline": {
    "address": "G...USDCISSUER",
  }
}
```

👉 Here, each milestone has its own **amount** and **flags**. Funds are released milestone-by-milestone (`500` + `500`).
